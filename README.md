# Welcome to the project!

This is the entry page of a sample project maintained fictionally by a large team with the following priorities:

1. Easy to maintain
1. Simplest and most intuitive layout and markdown possible
1. Single source of truth from which all other documentation created
1. Organized intuitively

The goal of this repo is to compare different documentation static site rendering tools and see just how much work is required to get this intuitive README repo into those solutions.
